# so_long

This is a project for 1337 school, where you have to create a simple 2D game using the Minilibx graphics library. In this game, you have to collect all the items in a map and reach the exit door to win. But beware, there are enemies that will try to catch you, and walls that will block your way.

## Installation

To install and run this program, you need to have the Minilibx graphics library installed on your system. You can download it from the official repository [here](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).

Once you have the library installed, simply clone this repository and run the `make` command to compile the program.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

./so_long maps/map.ber

You can replace `map.ber` with any other valid map file.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move your character around the map. Press `ESC` to exit the game.
